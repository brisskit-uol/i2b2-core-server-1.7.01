#  BRISSKIT README FOR GETTING I2B2 SOURCE INTO AN ECLIPSE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT.
#====================================================================================

Assumption: You have an appropriate JDK and ANT installed.
NB: The following notes are for i2b2 version 1.7.x, when the common package 
    changed name to edu.harvard.i2b2.server-common.

(1) Advice: start with a fresh workspace with no projects.
(2) Use the import facility from the file menu to import existing projects...
(3) When the dialogue appears, choose to import from an archive and select
    the i2b2 core source zip.
    (If you don't have the appropriate zip available, different versions
    should be available from the Brisskit Maven third-party repo.) 
(4) Select all projects to import.
(5) All the java projects will have .classpath files.
    Examine each of these and change all the references to edu.harvard.i2b2.common 
    to edu.harvard.i2b2.server-common
(6) You can optionally link each cell project to the edu.harvard.i2b2.server-common
    project via the project properties option (JAVA BUILD PATH).
    Jeff did this for consistency's sake.
(7) Build the edu.harvard.i2b2.server-common project from the command line.    
    The appropriate invocation is 'ant clean dist' from the project directory.
(8) Refresh the project within Eclipse.
(9) Then build each of the cell projects, again from the command line.
    The appropriate invocation is 'ant -f master_build.xml clean build-all'
    Remember to refresh each project within Eclipse.
    
At that point you will have an i2b2 system built and available within Eclipse.

The reason this was done originally was to get the crc cell into development to
change some of the code for the loader functionality. Such changes will/should
end up within the Brisskit svn repository.

To take Brisskit changes into development:
(a) Do the above, steps (1) to (9).
(b) Delete the appropriate cell project (eg: edu.harvard.i2b2.crc) and replace
    it with the corresponding Brisskit version from svn.
(c) Build the Brisskit version from the command line, and refresh within Eclipse.

WARNING and REQUEST. 
Try not to commit files from the classes, dist, genlib and gensrc directories.
Binaries contained in other directories are unfortunately required.
